# Session like sequencing for note capture to Zim
Created on: 2025-08-16T22:57:56

There is one small enhancement request:
Right now - say - I have 5 multiple Q and As in sequence - related to the same topic - I prepend a 001, 002, 003, 004, 005 ... numbers to the titles (in Notable) and then give them a tag. How am I going to achieve this in Zim?

---

Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôve hit on one of the trickier but also most rewarding aspects of building a ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù in Zim: **sequences of related notes.**

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach it as a veteran Zim user:

---

## 1. Sequential numbering in titles

Zim pages live as plain text files under the notebook‚Äôs folder hierarchy, so ordering is normally alphabetical. If you want strict sequence order, you can **prefix titles with padded numbers** exactly like you do in Notable. Example:

```
AI/PromptEngineering/001 - Initial Question
AI/PromptEngineering/002 - Refinement
AI/PromptEngineering/003 - Final Answer
```

### How to do this smoothly:

* Your capture script can automatically **detect how many pages exist in the target folder** and increment the next filename (001, 002, 003‚Ä¶).
* You can set the title of the page separately from the filename, but I recommend keeping them in sync (Zim tolerates spaces and numbers fine).

---

## 2. Alternative: One page per session with anchors

Instead of lots of tiny files, you can keep **all 5 Q\&As in one Zim page**, and use **headings or anchors** inside the page:

```
====== Prompt Engineering (2025-08-16) ======

=== 001 - Initial Question ===
Q: ...
A: ...

=== 002 - Refinement ===
Q: ...
A: ...
```

This has advantages:

* Easier navigation with Zim‚Äôs Table of Contents plugin.
* Keeps related stuff together.
* You still get chronological sequence.

Downside: Less atomic granularity if you want to link to a specific answer later.

---

## 3. Linking from Journal

Whichever approach you choose, your **Journal** entries can just drop links to the numbered notes/pages. Example:

```
Worked on prompt engineering with AI assistant.
See [[AI/PromptEngineering/002 - Refinement]] for details.
```

---

## 4. Auto-tagging

Zim doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äútags‚Äù in the same sense as Notable, but you can simulate it in two ways:

* Use `@tag` inline inside your note text. The ‚ÄúTags‚Äù plugin indexes them.
* Organize pages into **namespaces/folders** (`AI/PromptEngineering/...`). This often works better than flat tags.

---

## 5. Recommendation

If you plan to **revisit sequences often** (like evolving design conversations), go with **sequentially numbered subpages**.
If you plan to **search or skim later** rather than walk step-by-step, go with **one page per session with multiple Q\&A headings**.

---

üëâ Enhancement idea:
Your script could offer a ‚Äúsession mode‚Äù ‚Äî you enter a session title (e.g. *Prompt Engineering*) and every captured Q\&A goes into that session page with auto-numbered sections. That way you don‚Äôt have to manage filenames manually.

---

Do you want me to extend the script so it can **auto-detect if you‚Äôre in a session** and then decide:

* If session mode: append Q\&A under numbered headings inside one page.
* If standalone mode: create a new numbered subpage?
